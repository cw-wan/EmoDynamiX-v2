So at this point, I'm just trying to kind of figure out what I can, based on their website as far as cost goes, but that, um, month to month is kind of really important for me. Just like I mentioned, I don't want to be paying for six months or a year out.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "Right. Okay. So you're looking for some-something that's reasonably priced-", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Reflection simple"}, {"text": "Mm-hmm.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "-and that you don't have to sign a contract and you're right. It's hard to tell what the cost is just from looking on the website.", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Reflection simple"}, {"text": "Yeah.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "And I completely agree [laughs]about wanting to avoid the sales pitch-", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Reflection simple"}, {"text": "Mm-hmm.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "-um, element of it. What seems like a logical next step based on-- You've kind of already gotten the ball rolling. What feels like a logical next step?", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Reflection simple"}, {"text": "Yeah, I think, um, you know, I've kind of looked around and seen what I- what's available to me. Um, I think the next step would be to maybe go visit one place and just see, like, what equipment they have. Um, I also think too, I'd like to be outside when the weather permits. I like to walk. I just- I don't like rain or snow or cold, like, um, I don't like doing things when I'm just not in a climate that's enjoyable. So if there is, uh, decent weather, I think going outside and, you know, getting some steps in or just walking would be a good first start for me.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "Okay. So maybe visiting a gym and then also choosing a non-gym activity to sort of get started when the weather's permitting.", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Reflection simple"}, {"text": "Right. Yeah.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "I have one, um, idea that is jumping into my mind as you're talking. Is it okay if I share that?", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Question closed"}, {"text": "Sure. Yeah.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "I'm wondering about the price of the YMCA compared to other gyms. Uh, is that one that you have an interest in or have looked at already?", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Provide information"}, {"text": "I don't know that I've looked closely at that. I don't know much about their pricing or anything like that.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "Yes. And honestly, I don't either. [chuckles] I just suspect that it might be slightly cheaper than some of the more private gyms.", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Other"}, {"text": "I agree.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "So something to look into if you're interested.", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Reflection simple"}, {"text": "Yeah, definitely.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "And they-- I would suspect they'd be less sales pitch-oriented than a private gym. So it might be a safe place to explore first-", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Provide information"}, {"text": "Mm-hmm.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "-and to build some confidence in that conversation.", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Reflection simple"}, {"text": "Yeah, no, yeah. That's a good-good recommendation. I'll definitely check it out.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "Okay. Great. So, um, in addition to exploring the gym possibility, what sounds like a logical next step for a non-gym activity to get started, some small goal that feels doable, um, and you have control over because it doesn't require the perfect weather-", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Provide suggestion"}, {"text": "Mm-hmm.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "-or the perfect gym?", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Reflection simple"}, {"text": "Yeah. I think, you know, finding ways to walk more would be good, um, even if that is inside somewhere. Uh, I've done the like trick of parking in the back of the parking lot and walking up to the store. Um, and like I've also been in Target and taken an extra lap, which is kind of dangerous too 'cause you might spend more money. Um, but I- I think if the weather's nice too, I would like to get outside and try to find a place to walk. Um, and two, I really did enjoy yoga, it's- it was good for my, like, flexibility and posture, and so I would be interested in maybe seeing too what classes are available in the area. I haven't looked at that at all.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "Okay. So exploring some yoga classes. Is-is doing yoga in your living room appealing to you at all?", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Provide suggestion"}, {"text": "Home workouts have never really worked for me in the past just because there's so many distractions, and I can, like, set the mat out there and everything and get everything ready, like bottled water, everything's good to go. And then it just sits there and I don't actually do it, whereas if I go somewhere else, I'm already there. And so I'm doing it.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "That's great. It's important to know this about yourself, what works, and what doesn't work, and what you feel motivated to do. So, it sounds like we sort of have two small goals right now. One is to maybe visit the YMCA and-and find out how much that costs-", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Provide suggestion"}, {"text": "Mm-hmm.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "-and the other goal being maybe just a walk, um, one time between now and the next time I see you. Um, and I say one time, you can, of course, go more than that, but just with snow in the forecast, it might be reasonable to start with a small goal like that and go for one nice day between now and a few weeks from now when I get to see you again. How do those two goals sound?", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Provide suggestion"}, {"text": "No, that sounds good. I-I definitely think, um, I'll walk probably more than one time in the next couple of weeks, but, um, I also have this app on my phone that tracks my steps, uh, and it was like built into the phone. It's nothing I downloaded or anything. So I can also use that to kind of see if I'm getting more active 'cause right now I think I'm averaging like 2,000 steps a day, so it's like a lot of sitting.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "Okay. So you'd like to kind of get motivated with- with the use of an app and that might help you get started.", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Reflection simple"}, {"text": "Yeah, I think so.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "Okay, fantastic. So, on a scale from 0 to 10, 10 being really confident, I can research a gym and go for one walk, and zero being not at all confident, how are you feeling about these two small goals?", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Reflection simple"}, {"text": "I think I'm at a 10.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "Okay.", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Other"}, {"text": "Yeah. I think that, like I said, I think I'll find ways to walk. Um, and I'm at a point now where I've done as much research, I've found out as much information, I think, as I can on the gyms that are local here. Um, but I will check out the- the Y to see if it maybe is a bit cheaper and also a bit more, like, welcoming and doesn't require a- like, a six-month contract or anything like that. So I feel like those would both be good starts. Yeah.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "Wonderful. Are there any other barriers that would be helpful to sort of talk through?", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Provide suggestion"}, {"text": "Um, well, if I'm trying to walk outside, the weather's always going to be one, but I, again, like I said, if I'm checking, uh, using the app on my phone to see my step count, I can maybe make more of a priority to walk indoors, um, and just find places inside that I could walk, even if it's just around the hallway or whatever that looks like-", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "Okay. So being creative with your indoor space is a-is a solution you've come up with yourself for - f there just aren't any good days, nice days outside.", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Reflection simple"}, {"text": "Yeah, but hopefully there's one. So, yeah.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "Great. Well, you came in today feeling pretty discouraged about your energy levels and your mood and, um, feeling lousy about your body in general.

Head Start is a very affordable, very high-quality preschool program.

What do you see as your next steps in getting that going?", "speaker": "sys", "strategy": "Reflection complex"}, {"text": "Um, well, I guess just first talk to my neighbor and see if she likes this idea, and then if she does, I can talk to my mom about it.

Okay.", "speaker": "usr"}, {"text": "Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem.
