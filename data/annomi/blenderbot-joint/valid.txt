So Jean, I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important first step towards addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time, but as the first small step, I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week. And the reason why I say that- because as you were mentioning to me, smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it down helps make every cigarette a conscious act. And I noticed that you were saying to me, you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes. And sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you're doing. And that's often the first small step.
