    # DISCUSSION: LAZY VS. EAGER ADDING EDGES TO FOREST
    #
    # There are two approaches to getting the MST, one is to greedily find all the best edges, and then iteratively
    # resolve cycles through contraction. The other way is to add an edge and check if it introduces a cycle, and if so,
    # contract the graph. If we don't care about which cycle we contract in the former approach, then we get the same
    # runtime analysis as for the second approach. However, finding any cycle is much messier than finding a specific
    # cycle. Alternatively, we can find the SCC and pick the largest cycle in the first approach. Unless we do this
    # dynamically, this becomes quadratic and so does not provide a benefit. Therefore, we choose to check for cycles
    # after each edge addition to the forest.
    #
    # The algorithm presented in the paper (see README) is recursive and eagerly adds edges to the forest.
    # Therefore, Alg 1 in the paper is similar to mst_scc, however we still implement an iterative rather than
    # recursive approach for efficiency.
