#___________________________________________________________________________
# DISCUSSION: LAZY VS. EAGER CONTRACTION
#
# MSTs should not have self loops.  A self-loop edge could become the cheapest
# incoming edge when we greedily add it in the MST algorithm.  There are two
# approaches to preventing this (1) eagerly filter edges to prevent self loops,
# (2) lazily filter the best edges if they happen to be self loops.  The benefit
# of the lazy method (2) is that we only filter the "good" self loops (i.e.,
# "critical" self loops).  It also has the benefit that we do not have to
# preprocess the input graph to eagerly drop self loops.  The downside is that
# we have to pop several times from a priority queue.  If there are many self
# loop (which will happen on a heavily contracted graph), then we will pay a
# logarithmic factor in the size of the queue for each pop.  (If there have been
# M contractions and there are B edges, this is O(M log B); contrasting with
# eager pruning, which I believe is more like O(B).)
#
# There are even more benefits of laziness!  Here we are eagerly running all of
# the each edges.  Lazy merge would scale logarithmically with the number of
# merges M.  This avoid a potentially quadractic cost O(M*B), instead we have
# O(M log B).
